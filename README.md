This project is an exploratory implementation of a movie recommendation system that combines a simple Flask API with basic data analysis and content-based filtering techniques.
It includes API endpoints for serving and labeling movies, weighted rating calculations using vote statistics, and similarity-based recommendations using CountVectorizer and cosine similarity. The project was built as a learning exercise and is not actively maintained.
